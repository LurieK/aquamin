# About the aquamin Starter Theme

The aquamin theme is a minimal starting point for custom theme development. It starts with a white page with blue links that turn purple when you click 'em so you can add your own code rather than wrestling with a bunch of pre-fab stuff :-)

The aquamin theme is developed and maintained by [Aquamarine](https://www.thinkaquamarine.com){:target="_blank"} via [GitHub](https://github.com/tcmulder/aquamin){:target="_blank"}.

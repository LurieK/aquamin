# Custom Block Generator

# Theme Setup
 
 You can run `wp aquamin setup` after you've activated the aquamin theme. This installs a custom Patterns plugin that showcases aquamin's pre-installed blocks and core block customizations for testing.
 
 You can use the Patterns plugin for creating and testing your own blocks, tooâ€”I find it really convenient. If you configure blocks to work on another aquamin site and want to transfer them to a new site, you can just paste the block's folder into `blocks/block-library` include the block's Pattern XML export (e.g. `wp export --post__in=123`) in the `_demo-content` directory before running `wp aquamin setup` and your plugin will be imported as well.

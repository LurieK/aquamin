# Aquamin WordPress Theme

{: .fs-6 }
Aquamin is a minimal theme for custom WordPress development, with first-class support for your own Gutenberg blocks built right in.

Aquamin starts out as a white page with blue links that turn purple when you click 'em (i.e. there's no styling yet) so you can add your own code rather than wrestling with a bunch of pre-fab stuff. It's like a solid block of marble, full of potential and free of restriction, and you're the sculptor.

But as well, aquamin comes with a logical file structure and some handy, commonly-used features already set up so you can save time getting started. Happy coding!

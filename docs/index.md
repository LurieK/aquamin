# Aquamin WordPress Theme

{: .fs-6 }
Aquamin is a minimal theme for custom WordPress development, with first-class support for your own Gutenberg blocks built right in.

Aquamin starts out as a white page with blue links that turn purple when you click 'em—i.e. there's no styling yet—so you can craft your own code rather than wrestling with a bunch of pre-fab stuff. (It's like a solid block of marble, full of potential and free of restriction, and you're the sculptor.)

But at the same time, aquamin comes with some handy, almost-always-needed features already baked in, plus a methodology that makes it a breeze to template out your own custom blocks and other site components.

Happy coding!

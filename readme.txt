# The aquamin WordPress Theme

The aquamin theme is a minimal starting point for custom WordPress theme development. It starts off with a white page with blue links that turn purple when you click 'em so you can add your own code rather than wrestling with a bunch of pre-fab stuff. But, it does come with some handy, commonly-used features so you needn't waste time building them from scratch. Checkout the [aquamin docs](https://tcmulder.github.io/aquamin/) to get started.

A minimal starting point for custom theme development.

== Description ==

A minimal starting point for custom theme development. Starts with a white page with blue links that turn purple when you click 'em so you can add your own code rather than wrestling with a bunch of pre-fab stuff.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme require any plugins? =

Advanced Custom Fields Pro is highly recommended. If you're not going to use it though, you can delete the functions.php line requiring the inc/acf.php file, the inc/acf.php file itself, and the acf-json directory.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 - April 1 2019 =
